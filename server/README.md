# REST API interface for swap-core

This is a NodeJS server for using `swap-core` library. It stores your private keys locally and operates them, so you **don't want** to use share the server with somebody else.

To use your own wallet, place `.env` file in the root with your keys:

    .env:

    ETH_KEY=...
    BTC_KEY=...

## Simplest usage

1. Install needed packages

  `npm i`

2. Run server with

  `npm run server`

  or

  `npm run server-dev`

3. (Alice) Create order.

  ```
  POST /orders/
  Content-Type: application/json
  {
    "buyCurrency": "ETH",
    "sellCurrency": "BTC",
    "buyAmount": 0.1,
    "sellAmount": 0.15
  }
  ```

4. (Bob) List available orders

  ```
  GET /orders

  ->

  [ ...
  {
      "id": "QmWM4qK2jhQ3cyXpKF7qsKBa2WiVSprqGYhsEX9bxcPdZo-1527476621240",
      "isMy": false,
      "buyAmount": 1,
      "buyCurrency": "ETHTOKEN",
      "sellAmount": 0.001,
      "sellCurrency": "BTC",
      "owner": {
          "peer": "QmWM4qK2jhQ3cyXpKF7qsKBa2WiVSprqGYhsEX9bxcPdZo",
          "reputation": 10
      }
  },
  ... ]
  ```
  You can use `curl` or `wget` in another terminal window to access endpoint:

  ```
  curl http://localhost:1337/orders
  ```
  If you have jq installed for json formatting:
  ```
  curl http://localhost:1337/orders | jq
  ```

5. Extract an ID, e.g. `"QmWM4qK2jhQ3cyXpKF7qsKBa2WiVSprqGYhsEX9bxcPdZo-1527476621240"`

6. Start Swap:

  `GET /orders/:id/request`

7. Wait for acceptance from another peer, checking status:

  `GET /orders/:id/status`

8. (Alice) Accept request on another side. If many requests, specify peer.

  `GET /orders/:id/accept[/:peer]`

9. (Alice and Bob) Start swap.

  `GET /swaps/:id/go`

  Where id is an order id from previous steps.

10. Check status at:

  `GET /swaps/:id`

  Swap usually takes around minute to complete.

## Interface

### Admin

Server wallet information: balance, peer ID, addresses.

    /me

    =>

    {
      "wallet": {...keys...}
      "balances": {
        "eth": 97.72631876,
        "btc": 1.73163658
      }
    }

Aliases for `/me`

    /me/wallet
    /me/balance

List of orders created by the server.

    /me/orders

### Orders

Server takes some time to load and set up connections. You can see the list of currently accessible orders under:

    GET /orders

This endpoint provides full CRUD.

Create order:

    POST /orders

    {
      "buyCurrency": "ETH",
      "sellCurrency": "BTC",
      "buyAmount": 1,
      "sellAmount": 0.1
    }

Delete order:

    DELETE /orders/:id

See order:

    GET /orders/:id

### Orders interaction

Request order (Alice)

    GET /orders/:id/request

Bob now can see incoming requests:

    GET /orders/requests

And the accept or decline:

    GET /orders/:id/accept
    GET /orders/:id/decline

If there are more than one requests for the order, they are distinguished by peer

    GET /orders/:id/accept/:peer
    GET /orders/:id/decline/:peer

After that, `Swap` is created and everything else happens under `/swaps` endpoint

### Swaps

Swap info

    GET /swaps/:id/

Go swap

    GET /swaps/:id/go

Then, check status at `Swap info`

    GET /swaps/:id/

## Testing

Run tests from `server/test` directory
